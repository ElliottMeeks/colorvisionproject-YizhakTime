Red/Green Colorblindness Simulation
## Description
Get the red, green and blue color values from the user and store those values in a text file. 

The user will be directed to GIMP, where they will retrieve the RGB color values from an image file on the program

Since the values are from 0 - 255, there will be if statements and a do while loop to correct users if they input invalid responses

## Developer

## Example

To run the program, give the following commands:



Here is an example of the program running:


## C++ Guide

### Variables and Data Types

I created variables with the data type of "int" for the RGB values because they are only whoe numbers. 

I used "char" with the variable name decision to allow the user the chance to create another text file to write the RGB values and they are represented with the 'Y' and 'y'.
